   ```

3. **docker start**: Start a stopped container.

4. **docker restart**: Restart a running container.
   ```
   docker restart <container_name>
   ```

5. **docker logs**: Fetch the logs of a container.
   ```
   docker logs <container_name>
   ```

6. **docker exec**: Run a command inside a running container.
   ```

   ```

Troubleshooting:
1. **docker images**: List locally available Docker images.
